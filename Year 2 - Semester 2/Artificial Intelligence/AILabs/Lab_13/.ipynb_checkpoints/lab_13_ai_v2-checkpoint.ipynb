    "Doing this kinds of transforms is often referred to as **data augmentation**.\n",

    "**Data augmentation** is the process of altering your data in such a way that you *artificially* increase the diversity of your training set.\n",
    "\n",

    "But let's try one out ourselves.\n",

    "When a model is [**underfitting**](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#underfitting) it is considered to have poor predictive power on the training and test sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, an underfitting model will fail to reduce the loss values to a desired level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Right now, looking at our current loss curves, I'd considered our `TinyVGG` model, `model_0`, to be underfitting the data.\n",

    "| **Method to prevent underfitting** | **What is it?** |\n",
    "| ----- | ----- |\n",
    "| **Add more layers/units to your model** | If your model is underfitting, it may not have enough capability to *learn* the required patterns/weights/representations of the data to be predictive. One way to add more predictive power to your model is to increase the number of hidden layers/units within those layers. | \n",
    "| **Tweak the learning rate** | Perhaps your model's learning rate is too high to begin with. And it's trying to update its weights each epoch too much, in turn not learning anything. In this case, you might lower the learning rate and see what happens. |\n",

    "* A lot of machine learning is dealing with the balance between **overfitting** and **underfitting** (we discussed different methods for each above, so a good exercise would be to research more and writing code to try out the different techniques).\n",
    "* Predicting on your own custom data with a trained model is possible, as long as you format the data into a similar format to what the model was trained on. Make sure you take care of the three big PyTorch and deep learning errors:\n",
    "    1. **Wrong datatypes** - Your model expected `torch.float32` when your data is `torch.uint8`.\n",
    "    2. **Wrong data shapes** - Your model expected `[batch_size, color_channels, height, width]` when your data is `[color_channels, height, width]`.\n",
