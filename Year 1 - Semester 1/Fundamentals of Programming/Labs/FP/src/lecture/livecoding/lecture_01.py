# static typing - each var's type is known at compile time
# dynamic typing - Python interpreter keeps track of var type during runtime
# class = type
# str = Python string

a few more observations:

1. Most things in Python work, but they might not do what you expect
2. Python has a Boolean type so True/False
3. f() -> function call operator applied on function f

Main git operations:
    commit - tells git to "remember" the changes that we've just made (they are stored locally)
      push - tells git to syncronize the remote repo (changes show up on github.com)
